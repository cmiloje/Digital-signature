# The development of services for the digital signature with its own module to generate keys and digital certificates

Focus is on the development of our own application for the creation of digital certificates required for digital signing, on the development of the digital signature function, as well as on the verification of a digital signature with the help of digital certificates.

Modules used in this application are moduls for the creation of key store, the creation of digital certificates that consist of basic information about the certificate owner and the creation of a pair of asymmetric cryptographic keys (public and private) will be implemented within this application.

The keys are generated using the DSA and RSA algorithms, and are also used for digital signing and the verification of a digital signature.
